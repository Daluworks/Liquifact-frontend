/**
 * Not-found boundary for the invoice detail route (`/invest/[id]`).
 *
 * Compatibility contract (preserved across errors, empty data, and upgrades):
 * - Default export is a zero-props React component, so Next.js can render it
 *   from `notFound()` without any additional wiring.
 * - The component is deterministic and side-effect free: it never reads route
 *   params, search params, or global state, so it renders identically for
 *   every missing/invalid invoice ID (including malformed or duplicate ids).
 * - The two recovery affordances (back to home, browse marketplace) are
 *   stable public behavior and must not be removed or repointed without a
 *   migration note.
 * - All copy is static and non-sensitive; no invoice identifier or error
 *   detail is echoed to the UI, preventing leakage through the not-found path.
